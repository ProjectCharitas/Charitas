# Charitas
The new and improved Charitas Workflow!

## What is Charitas?

Charitas is an open source charity donation program that mines cryptocurrency using MultiPoolMiner, then donates all proceeds to charity. Our active list of charities can be seen at our [impact](https://charitas.co/impact/) page. Here you can also see our current holdings, whether they be pre payout, payed out, or donated. The developers of charitas, [jwstanwick](https://github.com/jwstanwick) and [Campinator](https://github.com/Campinator) take no percentage of the profits gained by Charitas.

## Security in Charitas

Charitas was made with the uptmost of security in mind. All of our user data is anonymized to give the user an unparalleled sense of security. In addition to this, we make all of our donations publicly available on our public [ledge](https://btc.com/14P7kJecY48Cd2jVmKNTwu7Sv3CkcQfESH). On top of all of this, we also are in the process of obtaining a 501c3 governmental license, which would further increase our transparency.
